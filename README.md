# Fastest Server Finder

This useful script can tell you which is the best server to connect!\
Usually, most of the time, some servers are down or have high ping due to number of connected clients, but the problem is that you cannot know the status of servers until you are connected...

## What happens after running the program?

1. Ping is taken 4 times from each defined server ip (By default, 6 servers are defined)
2. Displaying the average results of requests sent to servers in a tabular form
3. First server that has the lowest ping will be displayed as the top choice

> You can easily replace the current default servers. Current IPs may be outdated. Don't forget to call :get label a few lines below  the 'define servers ip' if you add a server IP
